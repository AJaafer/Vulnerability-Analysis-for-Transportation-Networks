# Vulnerability analysis for transportation networks
In this study, we examined subway disruption impacts in London, Singapore, Taipei and Washington, DC. My part focused on London subway system. 
First I built a directed, weighted network with 390 nodes and 2274 edges to model London subway system. 
Then I used criticality score (total time loss) to measure the impacts of single and pair node disrubtion and indentifed most vulnerable stations. 
Finally I analyzed positive synergy effects of stations shutting down simultaneously considering network topology.
