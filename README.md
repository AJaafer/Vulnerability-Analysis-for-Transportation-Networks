# Vulnerability analysis for transportation networks
In this study, we examined subway disruption impacts in London, Singapore, Taipei and Washington, DC. My part focused on the London subway system.

First I built a directed, weighted network with 390 nodes and 2274 edges to model London subway system. Then I used the criticality score (total time loss) to measure the impacts of single and pair node disruption and identified most vulnerable stations. Finally, I analyzed the positive synergy effects of stations shutting down simultaneously considering network topology.
